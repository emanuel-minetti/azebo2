# Azebo2
## Introduction

Azebo2 is an application to print working time tables.

It is a new implementation of
[azebo](https://github.com/emanuel-minetti/azebo) as a single page
application (SPA).
It uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and
[Zend Framework 2](https://framework.zend.com/) as a foundation.

It is a brand new project just starting, so there is currently no proper documentation.
Please see the documentation for
[azebo](https://github.com/emanuel-minetti/azebo).
